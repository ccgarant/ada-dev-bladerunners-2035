---------------------------
## Commerce
Built-in Website Wallets and easy integration needed
Wordpress and common website commerce tools needed
AdaPay working on plugins, and commerce solutions
Anything else?
Until easy integration and people don’t even know they’re using crypto, that’s when mass adoption will happen
Auto convert % to stablecoin immediately, pay in djed stablecoins, needs work.
Small business apps needed
Multisignature for security
Auto converts % of income into stablecoin 90%
Auto stakes all income
Auto uses DeFi like Genius Yeild to work with any savings capital
Auto employee paycheck distro
Store utility tokens? Staking benefits? Employee incentive lockup. Neighborhood employee incentive lookups.
Stake pool to exclusively benefit neighborhood small business ada alliance.  Neighborhood and employee staking lock up for discount prices. Win-win.
Auto generate tax forms csv files. (need to get rid of egregious laws of taxing on small payments, almost non-workable for small business).
