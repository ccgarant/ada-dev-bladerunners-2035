## 2035 Vision Lite
The year is 2035.  Cardano is the world's largest open-source Financial Operating & Governance System (FOS, GS).  Ada, the native token, is a global decentralized reserve asset.  The Cardano Network is fully decentralized and governed for the people, by the people.


# Present Day Ground Zero 2022
The following is a list of tools and projects that are fundationally important for Cardano's near term success.

For future vision work, see future_vision_notes folder.

Voting Tools - Voting Governance Tools based on Utility Tokens need major work, nothing exists

DripDropz Andrew Westberg and others working on voting tools for utility token governance, basically building it from scratch, as well as others.  Def seems like a work together standardized approach would benefit all. Cardano: NerdOut - Governance Snapshots
