# Roadmap & Brainstorm
Roadmap and brainstorm for where this project should head, what makes it unique and sets it apart? Or is it redundant?

# Scope:
- One stop shop for all things developers need
- Tools, Infrastructure, Projects
- 1-5 year look ahead #Cardano2025
- 5yr+ Future Lookahead #Cardano2035
- Prioritization?
- Alignment with IOG dev phases, i.e. Basho, Voltaire?
- Community requests

# Brainstorm:
- Rather than a dev resource list, should it be a list of tools that need to be made, or contribution, with priority?
- List of projects that should get voting in project catalyst
- List of projects that should be submitted as proposals for the next round
- Should this be a project management booth for community recommended initiatives
- List the best devs in the space, or projects?
- Brief description of top 10, what they are, and why?
- Should this be a website, not just a github? (For now prob github fine)
- Community voting on priority? (how to chose proposals to submit)
- Get best devs to weigh in on top projects.

Workflow:
- First time dev, sees page
- Brief intro
- Priority list top 10 things to contribute to
- Shopping list of projects in need, can pick thyself
- Resource list of dev tools
- Resource list of best projects and dev in cardano?
- After some open source contribution and knowledge check, help curate proposal for Project Catalyst (PC) w/ Dev? (Or rapid fund?).
- Will this turn into dReps to get delegated votes for PC?
