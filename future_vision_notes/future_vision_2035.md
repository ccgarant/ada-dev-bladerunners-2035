# 2035 Vision

The year is 2035.  Cardano is the world's largest open-source Financial Operating & Governance System (FOS, GS).  Ada, the native token, is a global decentralized reserve asset.  The Cardano Network is fully decentralized and governed for the people, by the people.

## Cardano's Killer App Niche
Decentralized financial operating and governance system that can be used by everyday people because of the low fees and permissionless aspects.

Banking the unbanked. Permissionless decentralized finance for all.

Governance in a box.

Business in a box.


## Reserve Assest & Payments
Ada is one of the world reserve currencies that has governance aspects built-in.  The network parameters, and thus consensus and staking rewards consesus need 2/3rds majority to change (a very high number, like chaning the US constitution).

The monetary policy is immutable, cannot be changes by governance.

The staking rewards formula scheme has been updated to be more fair and reflect fair pledge for newcomers and well as old whales (something like Draft CIP-50 has been implemented.)

Fast payments and layer 2s, zkrollups, hydra, and more.  Transaction fees on the main chain layer are enough for rewards.

## Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
There are tons of Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), stablecoins, cardano tokens atop the network, bridges, lending and borrowing protcols such that Mongolian Farmers as well as Wall Street CEOs have the same opportunties.

## Governance
Voting in government as well as neighborhood local economics is thru trustless decentralized voting.  There is no voting fraud, and it's open and permissionless to check.  Some privacy enabled to not see who your neighbor voted for, or social pressures, yet you know all votes are legit (aka no thousands of dead civil war people voted).

Cities and towns have bitcoin and ada treasuries, one store of value, the other store of value and passive income.  

People vote on what the treasury should be spent on, and how it's broken up between neighborhoods.

Grants are fully auditable.  Companies paychecks are fully auditable. All offical wallets are public and whitelisted for 24/7 real-time auditing.

## Ecosystems
Ecosystems, as small as a corner store mom and pop store business, as well as an African Nation State, have the same tokenomics and governance tools.

Neigborhood crowdfunding.

Local store token and crowdfunding.  Sell off if they do not sure community well.

## Supply Chain
High assurance supply chain can be validated on Cardano sidechains.

## Identity Solutions
Government and non-government titles and certificates are issued on the blockchains.  You own your own data and titles.  Ranging from Car Title deeds, marriage lisence, to small awards.  There is optional multisig for people who lose something, can recover it.

## Property Rights, Fungible and Non-Fungible Tokens
Artists as well as landlords own properties rights and get royalties and share real estate or rent.

## Interoperable
Interoperable with other chains, such as Ethereum and other utxo blockchains, notably bitcoin.

## Internet
Any tools, frameworks, or standards needed here to support.

## Legal
What USA laws and support are needed?  Staking rewards and stake pool tax frameworks.  Synergies with other blockchains (Tezos?)

## Privacy
Cardano needs better optional privacy solutions...
